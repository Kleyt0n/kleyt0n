### About me

I’m an undergraduate student in Economics at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ). My research interests include time series forecasting, sustainable finance, macroeconomics, and artificial neural networks. I participate in the Economics and Conjuncture of the Financial System (ECSiFin) group, which develops studies about the Brazilian financial system.
